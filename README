** You need help to start a Qt-College project in your community

We are committed to do our best in helping out projects that can improve the education of your country, region or village.
We want the project to be a success, and since our resources are limited, we need to work together to make a great and sustainable project.
Please keep in mind that most of the elegible projects will come from developing countries or NGOs helping out developing countries.
In order to be elegible, we need the following information from you, your NGO or government :

    * An introduction of the current needs
    * The project will use free software, both at the server and workstations (client)
    * There will be a local designated person that will be in charge of the project and the know-how transfer to the rest of the community. This person must be committed to be from the beginning of the project until two years after its completion.
    * There must be a commitment of knowledge transfer to the rest of the team. 

We will do our best to help you out with the implementation and training for the local team. Please send us a mail with that info to help@qtcollege.com and we'll back to you as soon as possible.
